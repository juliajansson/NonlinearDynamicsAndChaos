# NonlinearDynamicsAndChaos
A high school project regarding nonlinear dynamics, chaos and fractals. The report can be found when it's done 
(not yet!). The main program is NOT Main.hs, instead Plot.hs. Until I structure it differently is basically everything in the Plot.hs file. I have some minor helpfunctions in Helpfunctions. You can watch my progress in learning to program and understand this project iteration.hs and Plot.hs.
